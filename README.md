# ONIi18n
The repo to hold the translation for [ModI18n](https://github.com/ONI-Wiki-zh/ModI18n).

# Adding your mod for translation
To add your mod for translation, please make an PR with your `.pot` file under `/strings/YOUR_MOD_NAME/`. The `YOUR_MOD_NAME` here is not strict, just make sure to be different from other's mod.

To make sure all users of your mod have ModI18n enabled, you can mention it in your mod's description page or add ModI18n as the dependency of your mod (it should not add any noticeable lag to English users).
